  - Documented WP Templates tab: template controls, forms list management, creation workflow
  - Documented Form Templates tab: all 5 form types (Cover, List, Form, Grid, Drawings) with settings tables
  - Documented complete token system: date/user tokens, work package tokens, project tokens, activity tokens (including UDF1-10)
  - Added notes and warnings for key concepts (WP Name Pattern usage, Grid vs Form differences, sample data in preview)
- Help Sidebar - Action buttons implemented:
  - Back to Top: scrolls WebView2 to top via JavaScript (window.scrollTo)

  - Added italic "Search..." placeholder when field is empty
  - Clear button clears search and refocuses input field

### January 18, 2026
- **Auto-detecting Activity Import** - Consolidated Legacy and NewVantage imports into single smart import:
  - Added DetectFormat() method that identifies format by column headers (UDFNineteen/Val_Perc_Complete = Legacy, UniqueID/PercentEntry = NewVantage)
  - Removed ambiguous threshold-based percent detection (was using 1.5 threshold which caused edge cases)
  - Legacy format: ALWAYS multiply percent by 100 (strict conversion)
  - NewVantage format: ALWAYS use percent as-is (strict conversion)
  - Clear error messages if format cannot be determined or is mixed
  - Removed Legacy Import buttons from UI (auto-detect handles both formats)
  - Kept Legacy Export buttons for OldVantage system compatibility
  - Updated Import Activities tooltips to indicate auto-detection
- **Activity Import date/percent cleanup** - During import, cleans up date/percent inconsistencies:
  - PercentEntry = 0 → clears both SchStart and SchFinish
  - PercentEntry > 0 with no SchStart → sets SchStart to today
  - SchStart in future → clamps to today
  - PercentEntry < 100 → clears SchFinish
  - PercentEntry = 100 with no SchFinish → sets SchFinish to today
  - SchFinish in future → clamps to today
- **Export progress indicator** - Shows animated progress bar in bottom-right during Activity exports (both regular and Legacy)

  - ScheduleChangeLogger: Purges schedule change JSON files
  - Uses filename date parsing (not file system dates) for reliable age detection
- **UDF18 renamed to RespParty (Responsible Party)** throughout the application:
