## Active Development

### Multi-Theme System

**Current state:** Dark, Light, and Orchid themes with live switching (no restart). ~96 keys per theme. Full token reference in `Themes/THEME_GUIDE.md`.

**Architecture:** DynamicResource bindings throughout, `ThemeManager.ApplyTheme()` swaps dictionaries at runtime, fires `ThemeChanged` event. Views with Syncfusion grids re-apply `SfSkinManager.SetTheme()` on their grid controls via the event. See THEME_GUIDE.md for full details on creating new themes and technical constraints.

### Progress Book Module
- Phases 1-6 complete: Data models, repository, layout builder UI, PDF generator, live preview, generate dialog
- PDF features: Auto-fit column widths, description wrapping, project description in header
- Layout features: Separate grouping and sorting, up to 10 levels each, exclude completed option

### AI Progress Scan (COMPLETE)
- AWS Textract for table extraction, 100% accuracy on PDF and JPEG scans
- PDF layout: `| ID | [user cols] | MHs | QTY | REM MH | CUR % | % ENTRY |`
- Image preprocessing with contrast adjustment (slider, default 1.2)
- OCR heuristic: "00" auto-converts to "100" (handles missed leading 1)
- Key files: `TextractService.cs`, `PdfToImageConverter.cs`, `ProgressScanService.cs`, `ProgressBookPdfGenerator.cs`

### Work Package Module
- Template editors testing
- PDF preview testing

### Help Sidebar (Complete for V1)
- All 8 sections written (Getting Started, Main Interface, Progress, Schedule, Progress Books, Work Packages, Administration, Reference)
- 20 screenshots, Build Action: Content / Copy if newer
- WebView2 virtual host mapping (`https://help.local/manual.html`) — see `SidePanelView.xaml.cs`
- VS sometimes re-adds PNGs as `<Resource Include>` — always verify Content / Copy if newer
- Troubleshooting section deferred to post-V1

## Feature Backlog

### High Priority
- **Mobile/iOS Version (iPad)** — Execs want iPad app for field supes to submit progress. Needs architecture discussion: native iOS, cross-platform framework, web app, API design, offline sync, etc.
- **Import Takeoff to Create Records** — Create activities from takeoff data. Needs discussion on file formats, field mapping, workflow.

### Medium Priority
- **Theme System Refactor** — Phases 1-7 complete. Live switching works, tokens split, guide written. See `Themes/THEME_GUIDE.md`.
- **Claude Skill: Create Theme** — Build a Claude Code skill that reads `Themes/THEME_GUIDE.md`, accepts 3 palette colors + light/dark base from user, and generates a new theme file. Add to `.claude/` skills.
- **Create Activities Feature** — File menu item exists but not implemented. Needs discussion on functionality: possibly AI-assisted (user prompts what they need, records generated), or structured wizard, or template-based. Currently shows "coming soon" placeholder.
- **MSI/MSIX installer** — Replace custom installer with MSI (WiX Toolset) or MSIX packaging to get genuine Windows install integration. Current custom installer registers via registry but Windows Search won't execute `UninstallString` directly — only MSI and UWP/MSIX apps get direct uninstall from search context menu. Current setup works via Settings > Apps.
- **User-editable header template for WP** — Allow customizing header layout

### V2 Data Model
- Add ClientEarnedEquivQty column to Activities table, Azure VMS_Activities, and ColumnMappings (maps to OldVantage `VAL_Client_Earned_EQ-QTY`) - currently ignored during import

### AI Features (see InCode_AI_Plan.md)
| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| AI Scan pre-filter | Not Started - Local image analysis to detect marks before calling API (skip blank pages, reduce cost) |
| AI Error Assistant | Not Started |
| AI Description Analysis | Not Started |
| Metadata Consistency Analysis | Not Started |
| AI MissedReason Assistant | Not Started |
| AI Schedule Analysis | Deferred |

### AI Sidebar Chat (see Sidebar_AI_Assistant_Plan.md)
| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Chat UI | Not Started |
| Conversation Management | Not Started |
| Tool Definitions | Not Started |
| Tool Execution | Not Started |

### Post-V1: Drawings Architecture
- Design per-WP drawing location system (options: token paths, per-WP config, Drawings Manager)
- Fix preview display
- Fix layout/orientation for 11x17 drawings
- Implement Procore fetch
- Consider AI-assisted drawing matching (DwgNO formats, revisions, sheet numbers)

**Code disabled for v1 (re-enable when drawings architecture is ready):**
| File | What to re-enable |
|------|-------------------|
| `WorkPackageView.xaml` | Remove `Visibility="Collapsed"` from Drawings section Border (~line 238) |
| `WorkPackageView.xaml.cs` | Remove `.Where(t => t.TemplateType != TemplateTypes.Drawings)` from `PopulateAddFormMenu()` |
| `WorkPackageView.xaml.cs` | Remove filter in `ApplyWPFormsListFilter()` method |
| `WorkPackageView.xaml.cs` | Remove early return in `BuildDrawingsEditor()` and `#pragma warning` directives |
| `DrawingsRenderer.cs` | Remove early return in `Render()` method and `#pragma warning` directives |

### Syncfusion Features to Evaluate

**Dashboard Module (Post-V1):**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Column/Stacked Chart | Daily/weekly activity completion counts, productivity trends |
| S-Curve (Line/Area Chart) | Planned vs actual progress over time |
| Pie/Doughnut Chart | Distribution by WorkPackage, PhaseCode, or RespParty |
| Gantt Chart | Visual schedule with dependencies (complements P6 import) |
| Radial Gauge | Dashboard widget for overall project % complete |
| Bullet Graph | Performance vs target KPIs per work package |

**V2:**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Docking Manager | Visual Studio-like docking for flexible panel/toolbar layouts |

**Schedule Module:**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| TreeGrid (SfTreeGrid) | Hierarchical WBS display with parent/child relationships |
| Critical Path Highlighting | Auto-highlight critical path activities (P6 provides float data) |

### Shelved
- Find-Replace in Schedule Detail Grid - deferred to V2; may need redesign of main/detail grid interaction
- Offline Indicator in status bar - clickable to retry connection
- Disable Tooltips setting (see DisableTooltips_Plan.md)
- Interactive Help Mode - click UI controls to navigate to documentation (see Sidebar_Help_Plan.md)

## Test Scenarios Validated

- Import -> Edit -> Sync -> Pull cycle
- Multi-user ownership conflicts
- Deletion propagation
- Metadata validation blocking
- Offline mode with retry dialog
- P6 Import/Export cycle
- Schedule filters and conditional formatting
- Detail grid editing with rollup recalculation
- Email notifications
- Admin dialogs (Users, Projects, Snapshots)
- UserSettings export/import with immediate reload
- Log export to file and email with attachment
- User-defined filters create/edit/delete and apply
- Grid layouts save/apply/rename/delete and reset to default
- Prorate MHs with various operation/preserve combinations
- Discrepancy dropdown filter
- My Records Only sync (toggle on/off, full re-pull on disable)
- Work Package PDF generation and preview
- Manage Snapshots: delete multiple weeks, revert to single week with/without backup
- Manage Snapshots: grouping by ProjectID + WeekEndDate + ProgDate, delete spinner
- Schedule Change Log: log detail grid edits, view/apply to Activities, duplicate handling
- Activity Import: auto-detects Legacy/Milestone format, date/percent cleanup, strict percent conversion
- Snapshot save: immediate spinner, date auto-fix, conditional NOT EXISTS, sync optimization, elapsed timer
- GitHub 2FA enabled — verified push access still works
